# Dashboard for Fly Privi
This dashboard was created to provide insights into the [Fly Privi](https://flyprivi.com/) platform. It was built using Looker Studio, a powerful data visualisation tool. The dashboard is connected to Google Analytics and a Google Cloud Bigquery database that is populated by a series of ETL processes. The dashboard provides insights into the platform's user behaviour and flight data. It is a great tool for the team to make data-driven decisions. I have learned a lot and I am excited to continue to grow in this space. Please get in touch if you would like to know more.
